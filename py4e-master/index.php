The code for this site including the autograders, slides, and course content is all available on

copy of the course site, publish it and remix it any way you like.  Even more exciting, you could translate
the entire site (course) into your own language and publish it.  I have provided
some <a href="https://github.com/csev/py4e/blob/master/TRANSLATION.md" target="_new">
instructions on how to translate this course</a> in my GitHub repository.

This site uses <a href="http://www.tsugi.org" target="_blank">Tsugi</a> 
framework to embed a learning management system into this site and
provide the autograders.
