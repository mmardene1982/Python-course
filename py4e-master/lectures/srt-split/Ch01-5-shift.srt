1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,760
So, [COUGH] let's do a couple more little
exercises

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,300
that get you sort of in the mind set

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,060
of being a programmer, and how programmers
tend to

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,770
have to think about problems a little bit
differently.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,910
So, here we go.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,750
This I call this An Animated Short Story.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,940
And your job, I'm going to just give you a
differ, several sets of numbers.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,840
And I want you to find the largest number
in a list of numbers.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,460
Now, it's not so important to know what
the large

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,650
number is, but also to think about how
your mind

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,160
attacks the problem.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,540
What your eyes are doing.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,540
What your mind is doing.

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,940
How you break a bigger problem down into
smaller problems.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,340
How a human solves this problem.

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,500
And then we'll focus on how a computer

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,730
might have to look at the problem
differently, okay?

18
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,090
So don't just, like, get the answer.

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,260
That's not so important.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,150
Think about how you get the answer.

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,400
So, don't just like scroll ahead in your
YouTube and cheat and go get the answer.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,980
Think about actually solving the problem,
and then

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,980
monitor what your brain is thinking as it
goes.

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,950
So, here we go.

25
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,880
So, I'm going to give you a list of
numbers,

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,520
and you are to tell me what the largest
number is.

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,924
Ready?

28
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:13,676
Set, go.

29
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:23,676
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:29,115
[SOUND] I didn't make it easy, you're
looking for the largest number.

31
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:39,035
[BLANK_AUDIO]

32
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:42,332
Did you get it?

33
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:45,720
Did you have to go back a couple of times?

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,690
Actually I don't care what the answer is.

35
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,530
The question is

36
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,150
How was your brain solving?

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,390
Okay, you probably want to know what it
is.

38
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,840
The answer is 198, that was the largest
number.

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,270
Of course what I was doing is I was moving
it to make it difficult.

40
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,560
But here's the thing, how do humans look
at this?

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,770
Like, do humans, like, did you look at 25,
then you looked at 1, then you looked

42
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,590
at 114, and then did you just look at them
slowly one at a time, like this?

43
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,040
Or no, I doubt it.

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,910
If you are, maybe you're a computer.

45
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,580
Maybe I'm talking to computers, maybe
you're all computers.

46
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,710
I'm certainly not a computer, maybe you're
all computers.

47
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,660
Okay, enough of that.

48
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,430
No, that's probably not how you did it.

49
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,510
What you probably did was you had your

50
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,790
eyes move around the whole thing very
rapidly.

51
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,050
And the first thing that you figured out
is that there

52
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,610
were one-digit blobs, there were small,
medium, and large blobs of purple.

53
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,160
And the first thing you knew, right away,
was there

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,730
was no point at looking at any of the
small blobs.

55
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,180
Your brain just threw the blobs away
really quick.

56
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,840
Then you say, okay, given that it,

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,700
there's no four-digit numbers, they're
three-digit numbers.

58
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,890
Then what you probably did is you started
looking for the first digit.

59
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,670
You say, look, there's some ones.

60
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,330
Is there any twos?

61
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,430
Quickly, you decided there are no twos.

62
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,080
So you knew that you had to look for the
big blobs.

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,960
And the second digit was probably the
thing that mattered.

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,910
Then you start getting to the nine, you
say, okay, there's some nines.

65
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,970
So that means it's, it's one, nine,
something.

66
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,770
Then that was the part that you probably
had to go

67
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,020
check to find the, oh, where the heck was
the 190, aah!

68
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,700
Oh, 198 right there, [LAUGH] yeah I color

69
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,750
coded it, and I couldn't even see it,
okay?

70
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,350
But the point is, is, humans are great

71
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,000
at eliminating sort of bad solutions,
really fast.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,350
And you probably looked at how big, how
much purple was on

73
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,480
the screen, eliminating the areas that
were less purple, because you knew that

74
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,850
your brain quickly and instinctively
knew that

75
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,340
the more purple meant a larger number.

76
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,110
Computers don't do any of that, they don't
do any of that.

77
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,729
So, in order to make you feel a little
more like a computer, I have another test.

78
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,930
And again, the goal is not just to find
the largest number.

79
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:24,120
But to monitor as you go, what your brain
is thinking, while you're doing this, okay?

80
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,950
Do you get it?

81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,660
How are you attacking the problem, what is

82
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,970
your feeling as you're attacking the
problem?

83
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,470
Are you a computer or not?

84
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,431
Here we go.

85
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,847
I'm only going to give you a few seconds.

86
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:45,642
[BLANK_AUDIO]

87
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:48,653
[SOUND]

88
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:58,106
So, what did

89
00:04:58,106 --> 00:05:01,360
you get?

90
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,590
My guess is that most of you just said, I
don't care.

91
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,990
This is such a hard problem.

92
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,370
It's a stupid problem.

93
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,450
Or I'll try and turn my head upside down,
or something.

94
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,160
It's a really hard problem.

95
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,050
The other one was kind of easy.

96
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,630
Not that you, you might not have got it,
but you

97
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,410
had this natural instinct that allowed you
to approach the problem.

98
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,800
Okay, I'll show you what the right answer
is.

99
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,900
The right answer is.

100
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,370
Right there is 197.

101
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,790
Yay.

102
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,290
Right.

103
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,280
I, you can't even, even if I tell you to

104
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,110
you know there you are you know, what is
this?

105
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,620
Is this 500 or two zero zero.

106
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,280
Actually, the only way I can do this is I
flip it to find it.

107
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,320
I mean it's just not what humans are good
at.

108
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,030
This is a little bit more like how
computers see the world.

109
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,410
But the fact that the data's frontwards or

110
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,560
backwards should sort of make no
difference, right?

111
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,200
Computers need a strategy, we need to give
them a strategy.

112
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,700
Okay.

113
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,575
So here we go.

114
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:22,227
[COUGH]
One last experiment.

115
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:25,820
Now I'm going to show you numbers one at a
time.

116
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,804
And at the end, I want you to tell me what
the largest number that you saw was.

117
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:33,463
Ready?

118
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:35,323
Here we go.

119
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:37,390
First number.

120
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,969
What was the largest number?

121
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,100
As a matter of fact,

122
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,050
how did you solve that
problem?

123
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,060
You solved that problem most likely
because you didn't, you couldn't look

124
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,480
at all the numbers at the same time, so
you probably created

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,780
a variable in your head without even
knowing.

126
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,550
And you put into that variable.

127
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,890
You call the variable, the largest number
I've seen so far.

128
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,020
And you haven't seen any, so let's say the

129
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,420
largest number you've seen so far is
negative 1.

130
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,960
Then I show you 3 and you said to
yourself.

131
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,460
Well.

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,660
Negative 1 is no longer the largest number
I've seen.

133
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,400
So I'm going to keep that one,
I'll keep 3.

134
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,870
That's the largest I've seen so far.

135
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,230
And now I see 41, 41 is larger than 3
so I will keep that.

136
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:49,590
And now I see 12, now 12 is crap because
it's nowhere near as good as 41.

137
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,100
So I'm keeping 41.

138
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,975
74. Oh, 9.

139
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:58,660
9, not nearly as good as 41, so I'm
gonna throw that one away.

140
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,070
74, better, better.

141
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,690
Keep it.

142
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,620
Keep that one.

143
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,630
So I'll keep 74.

144
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,810
And the last number is 15.

145
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,620
Don't even know it's the last number, but,
we don't want to keep that one.

146
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,970
And so now, we're done.

147
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,470
So we know that at the end, what was
during the loop the largest so far is

148
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,350
the actual largest of all the numbers, and

149
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,480
we don't remember exactly how many numbers
there were.

150
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,880
So that's kind of like thinking like a

151
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,700
program, you know, this kind of sliding
window.

152
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,080
Didn't matter if I gave you a billion
numbers or five numbers.

153
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,420
I think there were five numbers, actually.

154
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,820
This notion of the largest so far is a
powerful notion.

155
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,400
As a matter of fact, it's central to the
program I've been showing you.

156
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,780
And I don't want you to try to understand
this, but this part in the purple.

157
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,210
This part in the purple is really saying,

158
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,910
I'm going to loop through the counts of
all the words.

159
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,810
So it's got a word like "the" is 15
times, and "clown" is four times.

160
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,090
And it's going to look through all the
pairs of word-value combinations.

161
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,500
And it's going to basically say, I'm

162
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,360
going to go through the counts that I
have.

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,090
And I'm going to check to see if the count
I'm looking at

164
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,230
is bigger than the biggest count I've
seen so far.

165
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,830
And if it is, I'm going to remember it.

166
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,990
Now, don't worry about this.

167
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,460
We haven't even covered any of this stuff.

168
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,200
That's what chapter two, three, four,
five, six.

169
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,750
But this is an algorithm, a paragraph, a
pattern.

170
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,930
That allows you to find the largest
number, and we'll

171
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,770
look at this again in great detail in
upcoming chapters.

172
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,180
So this is kind of thinking like

173
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,460
a computer, having a sliding window across
the

174
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,470
long list of numbers, and coming up with

175
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,870
something that is the answer that you
need.

176
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,070
Okay, so that's the end of this lecture.

177
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,580
Read Chapter One, write your Hello World
program.

178
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,060
Make sure if you haven't, get Python
installed.

179
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,970
As you read this chapter and even as you

180
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,430
install Python, and even as you write the
first program,

181
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,740
don't get too stuck on the details.

182
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,910
I was confused for like eight weeks or six

183
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,990
weeks in my first programming class;
you'll be confused too.

184
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,370
Just sort of wander through with me, keep
at it.

185
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,190
It will start making sense at some point
that's up

186
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,400
to you, I can't tell you when it's
going to make sense.

187
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,930
So, if, don't sort of stare at everything
until you get it.

188
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,590
Just kind of keep digging in, and keep
understanding, and keep playing and

189
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,740
sooner or later this'll make a lot of
sense to you, I promise you.

190
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,510
See you next lecture.
