1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,080
Okay, so that's sentences, now paragraphs,
let's talk about paragraphs.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,790
Paragraphs are the combination of
sentences to make

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,885
sort of a thought together. Multiple
sentences, multiple lines.

4
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:16,920
So, the interactive Python that I
just showed you

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,170
is fine for running one, two, or five or
six commands.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,700
But ultimately, we're going to write much
longer bits of Python.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,830
And so we write what's called a Python
script, or a Python program.

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,220
And we put these in a file.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,950
And we, and if you went through the

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,460
prerequisite, you will see have seen me
edit in a text

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,210
editor, saved a file, and then run from
the Python file.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,090
Okay?

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,960
And so we call these files put .py on the
end of them, P-Y on the end of them.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,220
And we're giving Python a script to
execute.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,902
[COUGH] So, interactive, you're typing
directly into Python

16
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:59,360
and it's doing it right as you're talking.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,550
You're still doing it in order, and the
order does matter.

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,220
In a script you type it all into a file
once and say Python, do it all.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,200
[SOUND] Now when you write one of

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,670
these things there are patterns for
combining these.

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,870
There are things that we do to these
lines that sort of treat them differently.

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,990
Is like a recipe, a set of instructions.

23
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,785
Start at the beginning.

24
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,300
[SOUND] But it's a little more complex
than that.

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,460
Some steps are just sequential.

26
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,560
Some steps might be skipped.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,800
Some steps we do multiple times.

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,600
And other times we have kind of like a
set of steps we do over and over again.

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,730
So here's some pictures.

30
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,040
And here's the four lines of Python, a
little simple paragraph.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,100
And it's got a sentence that says,
x equals 2.

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,750
Print x.

33
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,390
x equals x plus 2, which says, go grab the
old value of x, add 2 to it.

34
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,850
Stick it back in x.

35
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,380
And print x.

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,280
The output of this program is 2,
then 4.

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,480
because x was 2, we printed it, and we
added 2

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,570
to it, and then we printed it again so it
was 4.

39
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,400
Now, these flowcharts, don't worry, I'm
not going to make you draw these.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,760
I just draw these in case, cognitively, it
makes

41
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,906
it easier for you to understand what's
going on.

42
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:18,750
So, x = 1.

43
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,630
is the first step.

44
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,140
Sequentially, it just continues on.

45
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,520
It runs the print.

46
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,040
x equals x plus 1.

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,740
Runs the print.

48
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,150
So this is just straight through.

49
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,520
It'll make more sense when we see a little
more convoluted things.

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,100
So, this program just starts naturally.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,890
Python starts at the beginning and works
its way down through the end.

52
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,540
That's sequential stuff.

53
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,790
That's the normal order of business.

54
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,620
Now, a conditional is a step that may or
may not get executed.

55
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,370
If all we did was sequential steps,
programs would be kind of dull.

56
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,070
Right, they would just be like blah, blah,
blah, blah, stop.

57
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,710
So, there's things like oh what if you do
this or

58
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,520
what if you do that and so we do things
like if.

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,460
If you have more than 40 hours, I'm
going to pay

60
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,900
you a different rate than if I have under
40 hours.

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,320
Those kinds of things are if, the word if.

62
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,720
So in Python, the way we express this is
we use the keyword if.

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,510
So we say x equals 5, and then we say
if x is less than 10.

64
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,780
This is a question that's being asked, is
x less than 10 or not, yes or no?

65
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,060
If it is, we execute the indented bit.

66
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,400
If it's not, we skip it.

67
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,550
This case, since x is 5, we execute it.

68
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,250
Then we come back here, and we're going to
do another one.

69
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,550
If x is greater than 20, well, this turns
out to be false.

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,530
So we skip that.

71
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,230
So Bigger does not run.

72
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,560
That line never runs.

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,930
So, we, the output is Smaller, Finis.

74
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,790
Now, here, we can take a look at it, sort
of, in the picture diagram.

75
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,970
We run x equals 5.

76
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,840
We ask a question, this doesn't hurt x to
ask the question, is x less than 10?

77
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,720
The answer is yes so we kind of drive down
this little path.

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,410
We print Smaller and then we rejoin the
freeway.

79
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,220
Is x less than 20? No, so we skip and we
continue.

80
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,520
So, this never gets executed.

81
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,220
So you can think of it either way.

82
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,960
You can think of either sort of like

83
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,020
Gestalt, say, if this true, do what's
indented.

84
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,560
Or you can imagine sort of a little car

85
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,410
driving down a highway making turn choices
as it goes.

86
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,890
They're equivalent. Over time it's probably
you'll just

87
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,310
start seeing this and start thinking this
way.

88
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,400
But sometimes it helps to think about it
this way, for a little while.

89
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,950
Okay.

90
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,280
Now, the next thing I want to show you is

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,630
repeated steps, steps that happen over and
over and over again.

92
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:46,960
Okay?

93
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,700
And that again, when I said oh, computers
are good at handling a billion words.

94
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,760
Well that means it has to have a loop or a
repeated section, one for each word.

95
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,980
It's going to do something for each word.

96
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,570
And so,

97
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,640
so here we go.

98
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,000
And in Python, let's pick a different
festive color.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,830
Let's pick purple as a festive color.

100
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,280
So here's our program, starts at the
beginning, sets the variable n to 5.

101
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,550
And then a key word, reserved word while,
while

102
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,210
n greater than 0, again this is asking
a question.

103
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,670
This is asking a question.

104
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,080
Is n greater than 0?

105
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,130
That's a question.

106
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,870
If yes we're going to do this, if no we're
going to do that.

107
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,170
Over here if it's true we're going to
execute the

108
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,630
indented part, and then come back and do it
again.

109
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,120
If it's false we're going to skip down.

110
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,660
So it's kind of like an if, except it

111
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,370
keeps doing it over and over and over
again.

112
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,640
So, it comes in, sets n to 5.

113
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,830
Is n greater than 0?

114
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,850
Yeah, sure.

115
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,460
So we print n, out comes 5.

116
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,580
Then it says, and n equals n minus 1, so n
becomes 4.

117
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,850
We can change colors.

118
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,250
Then it goes back up.

119
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,948
Goes back up and asks the question again.

120
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:04,100
n is 4.

121
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,170
It's still greater than 0, so it comes
through.

122
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,090
Prints out 4, subtracts 1.

123
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,230
So n is now 3.

124
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,630
Goes back up.

125
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,855
Is n 0?

126
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:16,660
Is n greater than 0?

127
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,930
Yes, it is.

128
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,470
Print out 3.

129
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:19,940
Subtract 1.

130
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,530
Now it's 2.

131
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,513
So out come 3 and 2.

132
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,130
Then it goes back up, still
greater than 0.

133
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,220
Yes, it is.

134
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,410
Print out 2.

135
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,710
Or, wait.

136
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,568
Now it's 1.

137
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:37,140
[COUGH] Now we subtract 1, it becomes 0.

138
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,070
Is it greater than 0?

139
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,580
No, and we finally leave.

140
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,370
And we finally drop down.

141
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,480
And so the last thing that comes out is
the printed Blastoff.

142
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,420
So this is a loop, the notion that we're

143
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,585
going to run this little bit of code
five times.

144
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:55,770
[COUGH]

145
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,270
Excuse me.

146
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,000
We're going to run this little bit
of code five times,

147
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,750
And loops have these things we call
iteration variables.

148
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,480
And that is this n.

149
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,040
It's a variable that specifically is
changing

150
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,870
each time it goes through the loop.

151
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,010
And that way, we can sort of control the
loop.

152
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,340
We can decide when it starts and when it
stops.

153
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,730
We can tell if we're at the beginning or
at

154
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,710
the end, or the first one or the last one.

155
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,370
We'll do a lot of stuff with loops.

156
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,160
This is an iteration variable, because

157
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,146
we iterate repeatedly iterate through the
loop.

158
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,250
Okay?

159
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,654
Any questions?

160
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,760
We can't do questions.

161
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,210
Okay, so now, if we go back to the little

162
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,830
story that I, you've got several chapters
to understand, don't worry.

163
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,030
You actually got like through chapter
nine, so

164
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,040
don't try to understand this program right
now.

165
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,410
I'm just trying to give you a sense of

166
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,940
what the picture is going to be, right?

167
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:58,540
So, so here are some sequential
statements, because they aren't indented.

168
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,990
Those five lines are sequential.

169
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,120
They just go one after the other.

170
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,910
Then we have for, and it's indented.

171
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,050
This is a loop.

172
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,380
This is going to run a bunch of times.

173
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,120
Then we're done with that.

174
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,420
We do some more sequential stuff.

175
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,120
Now, we have a for loop, and that's
going to run a bunch of times.

176
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,060
And then we have an if, which may or may
not run.

177
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,570
So these little, this little block of

178
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,760
code is conditionally executed based on
something.

179
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,570
And here is the question that we're
asking.

180
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,700
So that's the question.

181
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,250
And then at the end, we do a
print.

182
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,340
Now, again, don't try to make too much
sense of this.

183
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:42,758
I'm just trying to show you sequential,
repeated, repeated, conditional.

184
00:08:42,758 --> 00:08:43,499
Okay?

185
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:48,110
Just, those concepts show up in every,
pretty much every program that we build.

186
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,770
Okay.
