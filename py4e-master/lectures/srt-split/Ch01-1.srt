00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,870
Hello.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,080
And welcome to Python for Informatics.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,630
Right now we're going to cover Chapter
One.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,650
I'm Charles Severance from the University
of Michigan.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,190
And I'm the author.

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,590
And I'll be your lecturer, for this online
lecture of the first chapter of the book.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,910
This lecture and my slides, and the book,
as a matter of fact, are all open.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,930
Open content, open materials.

And this video recording is also

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,440
It's important to be explicit about
copyright, and

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,630
so I say it right at the beginning.

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,580
So, computers basically want to be
helpful.

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,255
They are programmed.

15
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:44,940
[SOUND] Matter of fact, this is a
microprocessor.

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,260
This is really just an electrical part.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,280
It's got wires and circuits inside of it.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,190
And somebody spent a lot of engineering
time, to make it so that these pins in the

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,580
back take instructions from us, from
operating systems,

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,960
from the hard drive, from the memory.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,330
Instructions come into here and then
results come out.

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,710
It's really sort of a very programmable
hand

23
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,690
calculator and it's our job to put
instructions in.

24
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,950
This thing, in a sense, is wired to

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,570
be curious about what's next, right?
It's like

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,260
It, it's, like, tell me what you want to
do next.

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,170
What do you want to do next?

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,510
What do you want to do next, and after
that, what do you want to do next,

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,950
and it just happens to do that a
billion or so times a second.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,120
And, so that's sort of the, the low-level
piece, and, but you can also think, if

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,350
you have, like, a PDA, something like
this,

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,690
all the buttons on here are some kind of,

33
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,580
you know, "what's next?"

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,290
Right?

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,090
Each of those is sort of something begging

36
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,620
for my attention, some application
developer who's built a

37
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,940
really cool application and says please
use me, please

38
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,510
click me, I am sort of nothing without
you.

39
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,460
We humans are the things that sort of
cause computers to start doing

40
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,976
something and this will sit here happily
until I caused it to do something.

41
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:04,370
Now, [SOUND] whoa!

42
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,220
Whoa.

43
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,950
Hope it's still okay.

44
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,480
Yeah, it seems to be fine.

45
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,420
Seems to be fine.

46
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,080
Takes a lickin', and keeps on tickin'.

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,790
So, these, anyone can use, right?

48
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,800
They say even animals can use a Macintosh,
smartphone.

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,070
And so you don't have to be a programmer.

50
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,580
But to get this to do what you want

51
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,030
you need to learn a different language,
and we need to

52
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,940
learn the language of the instructions to
tell it what to do.

53
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,410
So, that's what we're going to do.

54
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,420
We're going to learn how to talk to this.

55
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Yo!

56
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,320
because it's asking us a question, we have
to give the answer.

57
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,770
So, what's a programmer?

58
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,490
A programmer is somebody who

59
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,470
writes a program, which is a script or a
set of instructions that tell

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,810
one of these kinds of things what it is
that they're supposed to do.

61
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,870
And sometimes you're running a program
like Moodle, an open source

62
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,550
learning management system, or Sakai,

63
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,010
another open source learning management
system.

64
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,330
And sometimes you'll even get paid to do
that, right?

65
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,800
Sometimes you do it for free, sometimes
you

66
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,500
get paid, sometimes you write things for
yourself.

67
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,900
And and but, if you think about it, all
these

68
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,690
applications on my iPhone, somebody's
making some money off of these.

69
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,430
They may not be able to quit their job,
but a surprising number

70
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,990
have been able to quit their job or
start

71
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,170
small companies, maybe not gigantic
companies, but small companies.

72
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,840
So these people that can put
applications inside of our computers

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,160
are programmers, because they understand
the way that we talk to these computers.

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,920
And part of what I'm going to try to do is
to get you to move from

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,850
the mindset of the end user who thinks of
this as something just to click on

76
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,500
to the mindset of the programmer, who's
kind of

77
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,680
on the inside trying to get out to you.

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,870
So that's, as we sort of move from user to

79
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,090
programmer, we move from outside to inside
and we think

80
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,420
of the world out there and it's like what
are

81
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,100
they going to put, push, what button are
they going to push.

82
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,450
So here's kind of a picture of that.

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,550
So on the outside, we're users, we click
on buttons, we click

84
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,600
on websites, we click on buttons on our
phones, et cetera, et cetera.

85
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,980
But what's really going on inside all of
that is there's a computer with

86
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,810
a bunch of hardware inside of that, and it
has inside of it data,

87
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,490
networks, other information. And software
is what makes all that make sense.

88
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,550
And so, part of what I want you to do is
I want you to stop

89
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,420
thinking about how to use these things
from

90
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,380
the outside, and we move to becoming a
programmer.

91
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,610
We're someone on the inside.

92
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,410
We're with the CPU, we are with the
memory.

93
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,370
We are with the network connection.

94
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,600
We are doing things on behalf of the user,
and presenting them back up to the user.

95
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,580
So, why be a programmer?

96
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,850
Now, this class is specifically not trying
to turn you

97
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,650
into a professional programmer, even
though I'd be very proud

98
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,180
if after five, ten more classes you were a

99
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,530
professional programmer. But that's not the
purpose of this class.

100
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,320
Sometimes you just want to get something
done.

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,860
You got an Excel spreadsheet at work and
the data's not right.

102
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,750
You got the data from somebody else and
it's

103
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,240
got like extra spaces where it shouldn't
have it or

104
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,120
does missing fields or something, you gotta do
something to it that Excel can't do.

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,640
And you're, you're stuck, like, saying,
Aw, I

106
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,920
want to, I want to mess with this data and

107
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,620
put it in Excel so I can do my job, but
it's a pain in the neck.

108
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,960
And I have to sit and bring it into a text
editor like Microsoft Word

109
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,530
and go line by line and make all kinds of
mistakes and clean the data up.

110
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,960
You can write a program to do that,

111
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,320
and that's the kind of programs we're
going to do.

112
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,810
Programs that serve our needs inside the
computer, but to serve our needs.

113
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,690
Professional programmers tend to build
things for other people to use, right?

114
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,650
They, they tend to build things that
everyone else does.

115
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,480
But we're going to build stuff primarily
for ourselves.

116
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,720
So.

117
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,820
What is code?

118
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,570
What is software?

119
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,660
We use these words pretty much
independently, a program.

120
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,530
It's really a sequence of stored
instructions.

121
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,790
We learn the language that this talks, and
then

122
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,110
we will feed the instructions in, one at a
time.

123
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,720
It takes them one at a time, it gives us
back a result, we give it the next one.

124
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,020
It gives it back, in, out, in, out.

125
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,030
So it's really a sequence of stored
instructions.

126
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,890
But it's kind of more than that.

127
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,290
It's, it's sort of like our creativity,
and if you've been using some of

128
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,040
my software, like my MOOC software, I

129
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,980
spent about a month writing all that
stuff.

130
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,700
And it's like, it's me.

131
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,070
I mean I'm, it's my vision of how cool
stuff ought to work, right?

132
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,380
And so it's more than just getting
something done.

133
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,930
It's also a sense of pride and a sense of
accomplishment.

134
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,580
Especially if you're giving something that
other people can make use of.

135
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,090
It's really, I think it's very creative.

136
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,580
And it's what attracted me to being a
programmer in the first place.

137
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,230
It's that I could, I could leverage the
abilities inside of here,

138
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,790
and I could do things, cool things, on
behalf of the user.

139
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,570
So, code, software, a program.

140
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,720
So, let's get a non-technical example of
this.

141
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,880
So, I'll have you link out to the YouTube
[COUGH] for this.

142
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,170
This is the Macarena.

143
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,700
The Macarena is a song that

144
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,750
has with it a well-known dance that
everyone

145
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,730
seems to know, or either get taught very
quickly.

146
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,993
So I'll, I'll stop and let you watch the
Macarena, and then come back.

147
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:22,016
[BLANK_AUDIO]

148
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:23,590
So welcome back.

149
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,680
I hope you enjoyed that.

150
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,600
In a sense what we've got there is

151
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,580
a program.

152
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,830
A program for human beings.

153
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,749
And, maybe you learned that at a club or

154
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:36,160
something, and they told you what to do
next.

155
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,740
Well, I can teach you how to do

156
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,160
the Macarena by writing a simple program
right now.

157
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,210
So here's my Macarena.

158
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,990
While the music plays, means you do it
over and over

159
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,570
and over again, to the beat, that's kind
of like computers.

160
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,620
They do things in a beat.

161
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,000
They happen to have three billion beats a
second.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,300
But as it were, so we're going to do this
multiple times so

163
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,180
we have this whole group of instructions
that we're going to do, right?

164
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:05,130
Left hand out and up, right hand out and
up, flip left hand, flip right hand, left

165
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:11,960
hand to right shoulder, right hand to left
shoulder, et cetera, et cetera.

166
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,170
Now this particular little program has a
mistake in it.

167
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,350
Actually several.

168
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,141
I want you to look and see if you can find
the mistakes in the program.

169
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:29,093
[BLANK_AUDIO]

170
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,480
So here are the places that have the
mistake.

172
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,040
Right?

173
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,850
The mistake is

174
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:43,910
right ham to the back of the head, and
left hand to right hit, not hip.

175
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,790
Now if you're in a bar and you take a ham
and you hit somebody

176
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,360
in the back of the head, that's not very
nice when you're dancing to this song.

177
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,270
These are what's called bugs.

178
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,550
Now a human reading this

179
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,910
would say, oh, I think they meant to say
"hand" here.

180
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,380
But a computer is much more literal than
people.

181
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,530
We'll see a couple of exercises where
we'll see that people

182
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,780
can correct little mistakes like this, but
computers they cannot, right?

183
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,560
So we have to fix these bugs and we have
to say

184
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,750
right hand and we have to say hip when we
mean hip.

185
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,290
So we have to be explicit.

186
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,680
Computers do exactly what we say.

187
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,730
They don't do what we mean to do.

188
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,800
So, let's clear that.

189
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
Here is another example, okay?

190
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,742
Let's see how this comes out.

191
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:34,192
[SOUND]

192
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:34,518
[MUSIC]

193
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:37,158
You're supposed to count the number of

194
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:40,580
times the word "the" appears in this
sentence.

195
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,830
Count it.

196
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,030
And the word "the", how many times?

197
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:53,015
[MUSIC]

198
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:59,373
Okay, it's your turn.

199
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:06,402
[BLANK_AUDIO]

200
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:07,033
Now, here.

201
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:10,212
[BLANK_AUDIO]

202
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:12,150
This is not something humans are good at.

203
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,690
I moved it around, I played a little
music, I confused you,

204
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,920
I put a picture of a clown car in the
upper left-hand corner.

205
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,130
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

206
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,840
Now it turns out that computers, once we
tell

207
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,490
them what to do, are very good at
concentration.

208
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,720
It can easily go through 30 words and find
the most common word.

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,250
Or three million words and find the most
common word.

210
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,800
And it'll never make a mistake.

211
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,649
We first have to give it a set of
instructions.

212
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,670
So, I don't want you to learn this right
now, but this is a Python program.

213
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,770
Let's say that I want to teach, let you
count words in files, okay?

214
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,510
I say hey, I know how to program Python,
I'll

215
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,670
send you an email, and I'll send you this
program.

216
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,210
Just stick it into Python, and it will
count words for you.

217
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,500
Right?

218
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,540
You've got a million words, million
lines in a

219
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,310
file, you want to find the most common
word.

220
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,890
And so, so here we go.

221
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,750
So I will send you this file called
words.py

222
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,810
I spent a little time, it's a friendly gift
to you.

223
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,640
And this is what I type in. Now I'll give

224
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,110
you kind of an outline on what this is
going to do.

225
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,630
First thing it's going to do is open a

226
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,480
file and read it, then it's going to
split

227
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,790
the lines and files into words based on
the spaces.

228
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,000
Then it's going to run through and
accumulate

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
numbers like, you know, this word is one,

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,770
this word is one, oh I saw that again so I
turn that to two.

231
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,650
That's what this does, it's a loop, it
goes

232
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,360
round and round and round, one for each
word.

233
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,264
Then what we're going to do is
we're

234
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,840
going to write another loop that's going
to figure out

235
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,688
which is the most common word by looking

236
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:45,450
at all those little histograms that we
built up.

237
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,590
And then it's going to print those things
out at the very end.

238
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,570
And this can certainly do Python words.py
and read clown.txt

239
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,730
and tell us that the word "the" occurs seven
times.

240
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,290
But, you know, it can go, it can find out
that a different thing

241
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,220
has the word "to" and that it occurs sixteen
times and it's just as fast.

242
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,690
So yeah, you have to learn a language and
you have to tell it what to

243
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,050
do, but once you do it'll do it for a
million or a billion words and happily.

244
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,510
So you don't have to do menial work

245
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,585
once you understand the way to
instruct the computer to do menial work.

246
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:22,520
