1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,760
Now, we're going to talk a little bit
about Python.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,690
Python is a programming language.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,640
Python is a way that we communicate.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,410
Now Python wasn't invented by computers.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,820
We invented Python as humans as a way to
encapsulate our instructions.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,690
And there's lots of different programming
languages.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,120
Python, Javascript, C++, tons of them.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,470
Python's just one of them that we happen
to teach in this class.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,560
Now, I'll start with a little Harry Potter
reference.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,179
Parseltongue is the language of serpents
and those who converse with them.

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,120
An individual who can speak Parseltongue
is known as a Parselmouth.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,350
And it's a very uncommon skill, and it may
be even hereditary.

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,580
Nearly all known Parselmouths are descended
from Salazar Slytherin.

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,950
There's our Harry Potter reference.

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,830
Python is the language of the Python

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,650
interpreter, and those who can converse
with it.

17
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,210
We're going to converse with the inside
of a computer pretty soon.

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,980
An individual who can speak Python is
known as a Pythonista.

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,340
It is an uncommon skill and may be
hereditary.

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,120
It may not be hereditary too.

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,480
Nearly all known Pythonistas use software
initially developed by Guido van Rossum.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,150
Guido van Rossum, this guy right here.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,390
Yo Guido, what's up?

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,860
Let's put a mustache on, yo Guido.

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,350
Sorry.

26
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,690
I should be nice to him.

27
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,190
He is the inventor of Python.

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,430
Python's over 20 years old.

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:33,330
He invented it to make it an easy language
but was both easy and powerful.

30
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,640
And that's why it's a great language to
start your learning with.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,680
It's a powerful language but it's also
designed to be easy to use.

32
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,088
Can anyone guess what the reason for the
Python language name is?

33
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:56,072
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:01:56,072 --> 00:02:01,695
So let's see.

35
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:04,200
[MUSIC]

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,912
Python was named after a famous British
comedy show that was in the 60s and 70s

37
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:16,250
and 80s, I think, named Monty Python,
Monty Python's Flying Circus.

38
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,640
And so

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,100
And I, I think he was trying to capture a

40
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,850
playfulness, a certain kind of silly fun
aspect of Python.

41
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,600
And and so there we go, enough of that.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,280
We done?

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,380
Yeah, okay, the music's done now, thank
heaven for that.

44
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:38,750
Okay, so again this is a language and this
Guido, he made it for us, he made choices.

45
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,960
He said we're going to put a colon here.

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,240
I think we should like indent this and do
these things.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,880
And he, he's made choices.

48
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,510
And [COUGH] and some languages have people
like some different better than others.

49
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,170
It's kind of an artistic choice.

50
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,080
And, and I like to kind of equate this to

51
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,170
learning a language to speak with people,
with humans, you know.

52
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,630
You know, when we're a baby we don't know
how to talk and

53
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,260
we start babbling, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. Maybe we just start crying.

54
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,240
That's the first thing that we do.

55
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,633
[SOUND] But we're like, we're like on this
strange

56
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,640
planet. We got to talk to this thing.

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,000
So we have to learn its language.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,960
And we're not going to learn it right
away.

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,750
You don't go like, hey study all night and
you know this language.

60
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,530
There's no way you can do that.

61
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,340
Although Rosetta Stone might be a good way
to

62
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,470
teach programming, maybe I should take
some of their ideas.

63
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,690
So, the thing that's different about
learning a

64
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,660
human language versus learning a
programming language is that

65
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,320
when we're learning a human language we're
talking to

66
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,510
a human, and they're going to do
correction for us.

67
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,050
So if

68
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,380
if I say a word incorrectly, like,"
Mama-alah."

69
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,630
Right?

70
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,050
I don't know.

71
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,800
That was pretty dumb.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,630
Someone listening says, oh, I know what he
said, I know what he said.

73
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,010
But Python and computers aren't really
listening.

74
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,130
They're kind of dumb.

75
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,240
They can't really correct our
mistakes for us

76
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,100
because they don't know what we're trying
to say, they really don't.

77
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,990
They're very literal.

78
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,600
And, so it is really common

79
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,490
in the beginning to get upset.

80
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:22,530
Because we say something we think is cute,
and it says, syntax error.

81
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,030
And we'd be like, okay let me try this.

82
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,630
And it says, syntax error.

83
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,010
And so we get this notion, and I had this
problem when I was

84
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,640
first programming, I was like, I would
like, here's my program, do you like it?

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,750
It would say, syntax error.

86
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,640
Now, the problem is, they could reword
the messages to be a little nicer

87
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,310
perhaps, but the syntax error isn't
really a

88
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,750
judgment on you that says you're a
failure.

89
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,400
The syntax error is really saying, I, I
don't know what you're saying.

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,450
I'm confused.

91
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:57,450
I only know a few things, and what you
just said is not something I understand.

92
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,800
So instead of thinking of the program, the
Python as some kind of

93
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,620
evil, demonic monster that just hates you
and just keeps saying syntax error,

94
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,220
think of Python more like a dog.

95
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,700
Right, the dog's, what can you talk to a
dog?

96
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,110
Can you say "lovely sunset we're having" to
a dog?

97
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,380
Because the dog's not going to understand
that.

98
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,270
The dog does understand some things
like food,

99
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,280
back, walk.

100
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,700
But it doesn't understand the accumulated
works of Shakespeare.

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,400
So when you talk to a dog, you've gotta be
careful

102
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,920
to talk the subset of the vocabulary that
the dog knows.

103
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,750
And so this is a key thing when you're
first learning.

104
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,580
There's only a certain set of things that
Python understands.

105
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,370
It turns out it's easier to teach you
Python

106
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,940
than to teach Python to listen to whatever
you have to say.

107
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,430
Things like Google make it seem
intelligent.

108
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,010
So you can kind of type anything into
Google, right?

109
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,150
Well, yeah, billions of dollars later

110
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,370
Google, for at least, like, short things,
can

111
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,210
seem like it knows what you're talking
about.

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,720
In terms of programming, it's a lot easier
for you to

113
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,130
figure out the exact precise way to say
it, rather than make

114
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,710
it so that we have to spend a billion
dollars on

115
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,100
something like Python to figure out what
you mean in your programs.

116
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,590
So, let's start talking to Python.

117
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,420
We're talking to Python.

118
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,320
So.

119
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,240
If you've installed Python properly,
whether it's on a

120
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,390
Mac or a Windows or on a Raspberry Pi, at

121
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,230
some point you'll be in a terminal program
and

122
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,160
you'll type Python to make Python run in
interactive mode.

123
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,060
You might have to type c:\ something
something Python in Windows.

124
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,580
But at some point you're running Python.

125
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,280
Now Python itself is a program, it's a
program

126
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,760
that is asking you to type the Python
language.

127
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,500
Now the interesting thing is you've got
this chevron prompt

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,610
here, and it's kind of another version of
"what's next?"

129
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,000
I told you that this hardware was designed

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,900
to always want the next instruction to
come in.

131
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,330
Well.

132
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,510
Python, once we start it, it really has no
idea what to do.

133
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,090
It is, is waiting for you to tell it what
to do.

134
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,900
Okay?

135
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,020
So, let me see if I can pop something up
here.

136
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,780
So here we go.

137
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,210
Clear that.

138
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,400
And now I'm going to type.

139
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,480
Get this a little closer.

140
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,280
I'm going to start Python, so it's the

141
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,370
operating system now is asking me what
next,

142
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,680
I'm saying, oh the thing I want to do next
is I want to run Python.

143
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,090
So, here we are, we're sitting in

144
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,340
the Python interpreter and it's asking
"what next?"

145
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,190
Okay?

146
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,745
Now, I, it's like I just landed on a, on
like a

147
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:48,100
planet.

148
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,660
And it's, like,

149
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:54,065
take me to your leader.

150
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:57,690
Take me to your leader.

151
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,290
That's what you always say when you land
on a

152
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,950
planet and are confronted by some kind of
a robot.

153
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,140
And it says,

154
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,980
Syntax error.

155
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,470
Remember, it's a dog.

156
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,970
It should just say aarf, right?

157
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,080
Could say, take me to your leader, woof,
okay?

158
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,770
Are you friendly?

159
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,490
I don't even spell, think I spelled
friendly right.

160
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,660
Syntax error.

161
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,436
Are you dumb?

162
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:35,726
Syntax error.

163
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:38,563
Pretty dumb.

164
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:41,344
I hate computers!

165
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:46,330
[BLANK_AUDIO]

166
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,870
Syntax error.

167
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,460
It doesn't seem to have a sense of humor.

168
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,910
Try this.

169
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,630
Knock knock.

170
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,800
Knock knock.

171
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,380
No sense of humor.

172
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,480
So here's the problem.

173
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,390
It wants us, it's

174
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,290
It doesn't hate us.

175
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,060
It, it just wants to know what we want
done.

176
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,150
So, we need to know the Python language.

177
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,320
Luckily, I know a bit of Python.

178
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,230
So I'm going to say, hmm, hey Python, I'm
going to want some data.

179
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,620
I want to make a variable named "x".

180
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,900
Just a little place in your memory.

181
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,820
Go find it.

182
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,080
Go find one of your spare places in
memory.

183
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,798
And I want you to put 100 in that.

184
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:33,190
Okay?

185
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,290
Do that.

186
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,130
Now, it's happy because I know the language.

187
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,099
Bonjour.

188
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,850
That we know the language.

189
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,370
Now I want to, but it's saying, "what next?"

190
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,100
So we have to put a program in.

191
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,230
So, let's see.

192
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,730
I'm going to say, hey, Python.

193
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,430
I'm going to make a variable called "y",
another area in your memory labeled y,

194
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,500
and I want you to go back and remember
that x I gave you before?

195
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,700
Go get that one back and add 50 to that.

196
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,280
And put that in y.

197
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,150
So now I've got something in x and I've
got something in y, and let's print y out.

198
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,910
What's in y?

199
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,220
Go look in y where you put that and let's
print it out.

200
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,850
150.

201
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,490
So.

202
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,750
We're doing simple things, and actually
most

203
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,610
programming is a series of simple things.

204
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,650
The number of statements, different
statements

205
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,020
you can do is is relatively few.

206
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,470
So we are talking to Python.

207
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,930
Let's run back to the slides, there we go.

208
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,490
And so.

209
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,010
We give it a series of commands and you

210
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,380
can do the same thing sitting on your
computer.

211
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,050
And [SOUND] you type exit or quit with

212
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,400
parentheses to get out of it when you're
done.

213
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,920
And that ends the interactive session.

214
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,090
Now this is interactive Python where it's
asking us command by command and

215
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,410
then interpreting or running those
commands as

216
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,520
we run the command, as we finish.

217
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,020
So.

218
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,140
There'll be, you'll be doing it in some
kind of a window.

219
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,060
There's a different way to do it on
Windows.

220
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,140
My install documentation on
pythonlearn.com gives you

221
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,490
all of this, tells you everything to do.

222
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,590
So now we're basically talking to Python.

223
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,080
So, what language?

224
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,600
I gotta still teach you this language.

225
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,380
So, what do we say when we get ahold of
Python, what kinds of things?

226
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,530
Just like any language, a human language,
there's like vocabulary,

227
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,710
there's basic words, there's variables and
reserved words in Python.

228
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,190
Then we kind of combine those in lines to
make

229
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,630
sentence-like structures that themselves
are not a full story.

230
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,910
And then we kind of make a story out of
it.

231
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,420
Now, the story is in the Python language,
not sort of English or

232
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,680
French or a human language, but it
still is kind of a

233
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,430
a sequence of small pieces that build to
make

234
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,560
bigger pieces that then build to make a
whole program.

235
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,040
So here is, again, that same program,
right? That same program

236
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,440
of how to count the most common word in a
file.

237
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,810
And I mentioned before that it starts by
opening the file.

238
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,310
It reads the data from the file.

239
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,350
Splits it into words, counts them all up
and

240
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,130
then finds the biggest one and then prints
it out.

241
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,240
So "name" is like a word, "equals" is another
word, "raw" is a

242
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,500
word, all these things are words, each of
these things is like a sentence.

243
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,450
There are blocks of stuff that are kind of
paragraphs.

244
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,000
There's kind of a paragraph, paragraph.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,150
I for sure, different color here.

246
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,110
Here's like a paragraph, and a paragraph,
and a

247
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,830
paragraph, and then at the end of the day,
once you

248
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,300
kind of understand it, and you will
understand this before

249
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,690
it's all over, this is kind of like a
story.

250
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:45,890
Right?

251
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,480
It holds together, it has a beginning, a
middle, and an end.

252
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,820
Again.

253
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,400
Don't worry about the detail, we've got
plenty of chapters to cover this detail.

254
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,370
Don't worry about this particular program.

255
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,400
I'm just sort of getting into the sense
that, you'll get it.

256
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,330
But we'll start simple.

257
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,370
So, the first thing that you gotta know
how to

258
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,100
do in Python is know what not to do.

259
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,160
Or when you use these reserved words, they
have very special meaning to Python.

260
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,280
It's like when you say, "I don't think
you're going to get any food today" to a

261
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,800
dog, the dog hears the word "food" and
nothing

262
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,760
else. So food is a reserved word for dogs.

263
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,680
Walk, bath, there are other reserved
words.

264
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,150
So, what it really means is you can't use

265
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,350
these for anything other than what they
mean to Python.

266
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,550
So, print tells it to print things.

267
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,250
Return is used in functions.

268
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:43,130
Else, if, these are words that if Python
sees the word if, it's like,

269
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,320
this means something.

270
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,060
Don't use it for any other purpose except
its stated purpose.

271
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,900
We'll learn what those are.

272
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,210
Now if we talk about sentences.

273
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,610
Sentences are kind of, in Python, like a
line that kind of have pieces to them.

274
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,760
So here is three pieces of code.

275
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,290
One is x equals 2.

276
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,560
That says, take and find me a piece of
memory.

277
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,160
In your RAM.

278
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,130
Allocate it, label it x, and stick 2 in
it.

279
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,380
This is kind of like a move 2 into x.

280
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:18,010
Then this says go get x, add 2 to it, and
then put the sum back into x.

281
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,070
Again, little sentences that are kind of
like subject predicate, right?

282
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,020
Especially this assignment, it's kind of
just, and then print.

283
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,680
Print's a reserved word.

284
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,790
Was one of the was on the list in

285
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,140
the previous slide. And then go read
that variable.

286
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,090
So, these are like three sentences in our
new little language.
