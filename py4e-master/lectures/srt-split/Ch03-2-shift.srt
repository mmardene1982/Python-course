1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
So, we saw in that previous thing one
block within a block.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,330
And, and we're going to do that.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,140
We can have ifs, we can have loops that

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,110
get indented, but then we can indent even
more.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,690
We call that nested, where there's an
indented

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,960
area that's in an area that's already
indented.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,270
So here's a nested decision.

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,620
And it might be easier to start on

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,630
this side, where I'm going to have
a first choice.

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,040
Is x greater than 1, yes or no, and if

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,490
it's yes, I'll do some work, and
then I'm going to

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,470
ask another question, and if that's yes,
then I'm going to

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,240
do this, then I'm going to come all the
way back in.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,608
And the way we encode this in Python is, x
equals 42,

15
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:43,213
if x is greater than 1, it's true, so we
continue working in the indent.

16
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:46,713
And now we say, oh, if x is less than 100,
which is still true,

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,850
so we go in farther, and we do this,
and now we come out.

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,280
We don't come out to here, we actually
keep going

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,770
all the way to here, so that
ends both blocks.

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,430
And so if you sort of think about this,

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,060
again this is where I want you
to start seeing

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,060
what's in a block of code and
what's not in

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,270
a block of code, and how the
indents sort of,

24
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,700
like, put a boundary on the
blocks of code.

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,390
And so, the first thing you should see is,
sort of, like, that

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,770
purple part, the, the x less than 100,
print, that's kind of a box.

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,440
And you can see the box on the, on the
sort of flow diagram as well.

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,830
The boxes are there. The boxes
on the flow

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,160
diagram are places where there's one
entrance and one exit.

30
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,960
And then there's also, sort of, the
larger box, right?

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,750
There's this if box that includes the
smaller box.

32
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,390
So, the, there's this nesting, which is
boxes

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,260
within boxes, or indented areas within
indented areas.

34
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,245
Now that was a, what we call a one-way
decision, where

35
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:55,735
you're doing if, and this code either runs
or it doesn't run.

36
00:01:55,735 --> 00:02:00,070
It is extremely common to want to
basically say,

37
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,610
look, I'm going to do one of two things.
I'm going to

38
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,210
ask a question, if the question is true,
I'm going to do

39
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,040
one thing. If the question's false, I'm
going to do another thing.

40
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,340
So that's what we have shown here.

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,850
We say, is x equals 4, is x equal to
question mark?

42
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,790
If it's yes, we're going to go here.

43
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,680
If it's no, we're going to go here.

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,930
We,re going to execute one or the other, and
then we're going to continue.

45
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,900
So we're really at a fork in the road
here, right?

46
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,470
We're, we're at a fork in the road,
going to make

47
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,750
a choice, and one or the other, but never
both, right?

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,100
So, we're going to do one thing, or we're
going to do another thing.

49
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,900
We're going to do one of the two, and

50
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,210
depending on what the question
that we ask,

51
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,180
the question that we ask is, which one
that we're going to do.

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,850
So here's a little bit of code.

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,700
x equals 4, is x greater than 2, the
answer is yes.

54
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,790
Then we come out and hit this else and we
automatically

55
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,890
skip, right, because we're only going to
do one of the two.

56
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,100
And here's the picture, x equals 4.
Is x equal to yes?

57
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,080
Print, done.

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,940
Which means we'll never do both this and
that, never do both, both sides.

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,000
We're going to do one or the other of the
sides.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,470
And just sort of
going with the box,

61
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,360
that is our box,
oops, go back, go back.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,960
This is our box, right?

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,850
It's sort of the indent followed by the
final indent.

64
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,960
The else is really kind of part of it.

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,420
And then we can draw the picture here.
It has one entry and one exit.

66
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,274
Okay.
So we have one-way ifs, and we have

67
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:40,360
two-way ifs, and now we have multi-way
ifs, okay?

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,550
So, here is a multi-way if,

69
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:55,432
and it introduces a new reserved word, elif,

70
00:03:55,432 --> 00:03:58,020
which is a combination of else and if.

71
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,700
And this one, probably, is just as easy to
talk about the picture here.

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,766
The first question is asked, there's still

73
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,860
going to only be one, there's only
going to

74
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,740
be one, one and only one of these three
choices are going to run.

75
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,300
Once it's run one, then it's done, okay?

76
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,430
So the, the way to think about this, if x
is less than 2, we're going to

77
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,880
run this one, and then we're going to
kind of

78
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,450
flush all the way out to the bottom.

79
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,050
If x is not less than 2, and it's less
than 10,

80
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,562
we're going to run this one, then
flush out the bottom.

81
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:30,650
And if x is not less than 2, and x is not

82
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:36,440
less than 10, we're going to run this one,
and flush out the bottom.

83
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,049
So, one of these three, one, two, three,
one of those three is going to run.

84
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:47,350
And it's going to run based on the
questions that are being asked.

85
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,692
The questions do get asked

86
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:51,237
in an order, and the order
does matter, okay?

87
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:54,048
So that is a multi-way if.

88
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:59,400
If, else if, else.
So this is kind of like an otherwise.

89
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,400
The else is like an otherwise, you know,
one way or another, we're going to run

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,860
something, and if none of these first two
have run, we will run this one.

91
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,040
We call it a multi-way if, okay?

92
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,530
So, here's an example
of our multi-way if.

93
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,771
That, if we say x equals 0, x equals 0.

94
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:20,590
Is it less than 2?

95
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,640
Yes, it is.

96
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,320
So we run Small, print Small, and then we
flush out the bottom.

97
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,680
If we switch, instead, x to 5, x is 5.

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,086
Is it less than 2?
No, it is not less than 2.

99
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:34,923
Is it less than 10?

100
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:38,766
Well, 5 is less than 10.
So the answer is yes, so we print Medium,

101
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:43,660
then we flush out the bottom.
One and only one are going to execute.

102
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,265
Now, in this case, we got x is 20.

103
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:50,230
And so we come through here.
Is it less than 2?

104
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,410
No, it is not.

105
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,370
Is it less than 10?
No, it is not.

106
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,660
So we're going to do this one, and then
flush out the bottom.

107
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:03,330
If we go here, it's false, false, go here,
all else being equal, we run that one.

108
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,770
So this one doesn't run

109
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,250
and that one doesn't run, right?
Because these are like gateways.

110
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,380
If it were true, it would run it.

111
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,660
But it's false, so we're going to skip it.

112
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,340
This one, it's false, so we're going to
skip it.

113
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,270
But then we hit the else, that's like a
catch-all.

114
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,743
And then if none of these were true,
then it will run the else.

115
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:26,325
Any questions?

116
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,293
Okay.
Well,

117
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:33,350
I'm going to ask you a question, in a
second.

118
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,700
Okay, so just a couple of things that
probably you're wondering about.

119
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,880
You don't actually need an else.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,380
You can have a multi-way, x equals 5, if x
is less than 2, there's no else here.

121
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,580
You'll notice that this print just comes
back.

122
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,440
And so this way, it could, if both of
these are false, it could

123
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,240
skip them both and just run right through
here, and there's no else clause, okay?

124
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,470
So, in this case, if this one's

125
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,920
going to, the way this one's going to run
is, x equals 5

126
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,190
if x is less than 2, it's, it's not.

127
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,035
And it skips to here.

128
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:13,900
Else if x is less than 10, which it
is, it will run that one and come here.

129
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,840
But, for a different value of x, like 95,
boop boop.

130
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,530
If x was 95, or 59, this would be false.
It would skip it.

131
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,662
This would, elif, would still be false,
and it would skip it,

132
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:32,955
and the only thing it would print out
would be, All done. Okay?

133
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:37,620
Okay, you can also have many elifs.

134
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,695
So, better change to green.

135
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,578
It checks this one, if it's true, it runs
the first one.

136
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:45,863
If it's false, it checks this one.

137
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:49,990
If that's true, it run this one, and then
it skips, right?

138
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,580
And so, so the way to think about

139
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,770
this is, is, it just goes through and
checks this one

140
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,060
false, this one false, false, false, oh, I
finally found one.

141
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,950
And now I'm done.

142
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,240
It still is going to do one and only one
of these.

143
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,914
This one has an else, so that sooner or
later, it is going to do one.

144
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:14,453
And it only will do the else if all of
these are false. All have to be false.

145
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,250
Then it will, actually, come and hit the
else clause.

146
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:20,160
It's great, because there are lots of
situations where

147
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,090
you're like, oh, is it before eight in the
morning?

148
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,920
Or is it between eight and noon?

149
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,820
Or is it between noon and five?

150
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,530
Or after five? After midnight?
I don't know.

151
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,460
Okay, so, here, coming up, is a question.

152
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
And, you, there's two puzzles
and I'm going to

153
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,209
stop so you can look at them for a while.

154
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,561
And I want you to figure out,

155
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,893
in both sides of this, which of the lines

156
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:51,480
will not execute, regardless of the value
for x.

157
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,570
So in both sides, there is a line

158
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,740
that won't execute, regardless of the
value for x.

159
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,930
Which will never print?

160
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,960
There's two problems, problem A and
problem B.

161
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,026
Okay, I'll have some coffee while you
think.

162
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:09,026
[NOISE].

163
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:23,720
Okay, hopefully you paused it so that you
could actually think for a bit.

164
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,230
So, so I'm going to guess you probably

165
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,190
got the first one right, that's pretty
straightforward.

166
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,212
I mean, actually, you're in great shape
if you got both of them right.

167
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,268
If you got any of them right,
you're in great shape

168
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,064
because that means
you're starting to get it.

169
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:39,907
Starting to like, oh, I'm seeing, kind of,
this flow picture, there's a picture.

170
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:41,794
I look at these characters that seemingly

171
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:44,380
look like gibberish, and a picture
arrives.

172
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,460
Or a pattern of access execution arises.

173
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,000
That's what we want to see.

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,030
So, the in the first one, which will
never print?

175
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,640
Well, we're looking for kind of a value
for x which will be defective.

176
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,010
So if x is less than 2, we're going
to do this.

177
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,720
Else, if x is greater than or equal to 2,
we'll do this, else we'll do that.

178
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,400
Well, here's the problem with this one.

179
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,900
For all values of x, it is, is either going,

180
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,420
x is less than 2 is either going to be
true or greater than equal to 2.

181
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,310
Greater than or equal to be, pah,
for X to be

182
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,960
greater than or equal to 2 is
going to be true.

183
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,260
So it's going to run this one, or it's
going to run that one.

184
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,720
So for big numbers, numbers above 2,

185
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,400
it's going to run this one;
below 2, it's going to run that one.

186
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,810
So this one is never going to run, okay?

187
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,920
Because the, one of the first two is
going to be

188
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,070
true, and so the third else situation
is not going to run.

189
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,870
Hope you got that right.

190
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,290
Okay, so let's take a look at the next
one, okay?

191
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,310
So the question is, you know, if x is less
than 2, do this,

192
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,850
if x is less 20, do that, and if x is less
than 10, do this,

193
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,324
and otherwise do that.
Well, the one that will never execute

194
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:58,759
is this one. And, x equals 15,

195
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,727
no, x equals 15 is a bad one,
x equals 5 is the one that will,

196
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:08,716
sort of, cause it to behave badly.

197
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:13,390
And so, if x is 5, this is false.

198
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,066
If x is less than 20, this is true, and
then it's done.

199
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:23,398
So the problem is, this is the one that
will never execute, because

200
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:28,796
if a value is less than 10, it's also
less than 20, so this will be true.

201
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:31,376
So for a value like 5, which happens to be
less than 10,

202
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:35,160
which you would think would cause that
line to execute, does not.

203
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,910
This one executes because it's checked
first.

204
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,100
Now, if we just moved this code, took this
code and

205
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,800
we moved it down here, then it would make
more sense, okay?

206
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,530
Oops.

207
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,710
If we moved it down there, it would make
more sense.

208
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,700
But basically, the answer to these is,
change color, this one won't

209
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,660
execute, and this one will never execute
for any value, so there's the answer.

210
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,660
Okay, so we're almost done with
conditionals.
