1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,260
So, [COUGH] let's do a couple more little
exercises

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,800
that get you sort of in the mind set

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,560
of being a programmer, and how programmers
tend to

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,270
have to think about problems a little bit
differently.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,410
So, here we go.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,250
This I call this An Animated Short Story.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,440
And your job, I'm going to just give you a
differ, several sets of numbers.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,340
And I want you to find the largest number
in a list of numbers.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,960
Now, it's not so important to know what
the large

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,150
number is, but also to think about how
your mind

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,660
attacks the problem.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,040
What your eyes are doing.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
What your mind is doing.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,440
How you break a bigger problem down into
smaller problems.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,840
How a human solves this problem.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,000
And then we'll focus on how a computer

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,230
might have to look at the problem
differently, okay?

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,590
So don't just, like, get the answer.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,760
That's not so important.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,650
Think about how you get the answer.

21
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,900
So, don't just like scroll ahead in your
YouTube and cheat and go get the answer.

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,480
Think about actually solving the problem,
and then

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,480
monitor what your brain is thinking as it
goes.

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,450
So, here we go.

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,380
So, I'm going to give you a list of
numbers,

26
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,020
and you are to tell me what the largest
number is.

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,424
Ready?

28
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:15,176
Set, go.

29
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:25,176
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:30,615
[SOUND] I didn't make it easy, you're
looking for the largest number.

31
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:40,535
[BLANK_AUDIO]

32
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:43,832
Did you get it?

33
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:47,220
Did you have to go back a couple of times?

34
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,190
Actually I don't care what the answer is.

35
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,030
The question is

36
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,650
How was your brain solving?

37
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,890
Okay, you probably want to know what it
is.

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,340
The answer is 198, that was the largest
number.

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,770
Of course what I was doing is I was moving
it to make it difficult.

40
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,060
But here's the thing, how do humans look
at this?

41
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,270
Like, do humans, like, did you look at 25,
then you looked at 1, then you looked

42
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,090
at 114, and then did you just look at them
slowly one at a time, like this?

43
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,540
Or no, I doubt it.

44
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,410
If you are, maybe you're a computer.

45
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,080
Maybe I'm talking to computers, maybe
you're all computers.

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,210
I'm certainly not a computer, maybe you're
all computers.

47
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,160
Okay, enough of that.

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,930
No, that's probably not how you did it.

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,010
What you probably did was you had your

50
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,290
eyes move around the whole thing very
rapidly.

51
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,550
And the first thing that you figured out
is that there

52
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,110
were one-digit blobs, there were small,
medium, and large blobs of purple.

53
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,660
And the first thing you knew, right away,
was there

54
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,230
was no point at looking at any of the
small blobs.

55
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,680
Your brain just threw the blobs away
really quick.

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,340
Then you say, okay, given that it,

57
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,200
there's no four-digit numbers, they're
three-digit numbers.

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,390
Then what you probably did is you started
looking for the first digit.

59
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,170
You say, look, there's some ones.

60
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,830
Is there any twos?

61
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,930
Quickly, you decided there are no twos.

62
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,580
So you knew that you had to look for the
big blobs.

63
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,460
And the second digit was probably the
thing that mattered.

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,410
Then you start getting to the nine, you
say, okay, there's some nines.

65
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,470
So that means it's, it's one, nine,
something.

66
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,270
Then that was the part that you probably
had to go

67
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,520
check to find the, oh, where the heck was
the 190, aah!

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,200
Oh, 198 right there, [LAUGH] yeah I color

69
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,250
coded it, and I couldn't even see it,
okay?

70
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,850
But the point is, is, humans are great

71
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,500
at eliminating sort of bad solutions,
really fast.

72
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,850
And you probably looked at how big, how
much purple was on

73
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,980
the screen, eliminating the areas that
were less purple, because you knew that

74
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,350
your brain quickly and instinctively
knew that

75
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,840
the more purple meant a larger number.

76
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,610
Computers don't do any of that, they don't
do any of that.

77
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:12,229
So, in order to make you feel a little
more like a computer, I have another test.

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,430
And again, the goal is not just to find
the largest number.

79
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:25,620
But to monitor as you go, what your brain
is thinking, while you're doing this, okay?

80
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,450
Do you get it?

81
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,160
How are you attacking the problem, what is

82
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,470
your feeling as you're attacking the
problem?

83
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,970
Are you a computer or not?

84
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,931
Here we go.

85
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:39,347
I'm only going to give you a few seconds.

86
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:47,142
[BLANK_AUDIO]

87
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:50,153
[SOUND]

88
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:59,606
So, what did

89
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:02,860
you get?

90
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,090
My guess is that most of you just said, I
don't care.

91
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,490
This is such a hard problem.

92
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,870
It's a stupid problem.

93
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,950
Or I'll try and turn my head upside down,
or something.

94
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,660
It's a really hard problem.

95
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,550
The other one was kind of easy.

96
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,130
Not that you, you might not have got it,
but you

97
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,910
had this natural instinct that allowed you
to approach the problem.

98
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,300
Okay, I'll show you what the right answer
is.

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,400
The right answer is.

100
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,870
Right there is 197.

101
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,290
Yay.

102
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,790
Right.

103
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,780
I, you can't even, even if I tell you to

104
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,610
you know there you are you know, what is
this?

105
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:52,120
Is this 500 or two zero zero.

106
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,780
Actually, the only way I can do this is I
flip it to find it.

107
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,820
I mean it's just not what humans are good
at.

108
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,530
This is a little bit more like how
computers see the world.

109
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,910
But the fact that the data's frontwards or

110
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,060
backwards should sort of make no
difference, right?

111
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,700
Computers need a strategy, we need to give
them a strategy.

112
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,200
Okay.

113
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,075
So here we go.

114
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:23,727
[COUGH]
One last experiment.

115
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:27,320
Now I'm going to show you numbers one at a
time.

116
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,304
And at the end, I want you to tell me what
the largest number that you saw was.

117
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,963
Ready?

118
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:36,823
Here we go.

119
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:38,890
First number.

120
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,469
What was the largest number?

121
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,600
As a matter of fact,

122
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,550
how did you solve that
problem?

123
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,560
You solved that problem most likely
because you didn't, you couldn't look

124
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,980
at all the numbers at the same time, so
you probably created

125
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,280
a variable in your head without even
knowing.

126
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,050
And you put into that variable.

127
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,390
You call the variable, the largest number
I've seen so far.

128
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,520
And you haven't seen any, so let's say the

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,920
largest number you've seen so far is
negative 1.

130
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,460
Then I show you 3 and you said to
yourself.

131
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:31,960
Well.

132
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,160
Negative 1 is no longer the largest number
I've seen.

133
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,900
So I'm going to keep that one,
I'll keep 3.

134
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,370
That's the largest I've seen so far.

135
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,730
And now I see 41, 41 is larger than 3
so I will keep that.

136
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:51,090
And now I see 12, now 12 is crap because
it's nowhere near as good as 41.

137
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,600
So I'm keeping 41.

138
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,475
74. Oh, 9.

139
00:07:53,475 --> 00:08:00,160
9, not nearly as good as 41, so I'm
gonna throw that one away.

140
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,570
74, better, better.

141
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,190
Keep it.

142
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,120
Keep that one.

143
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,130
So I'll keep 74.

144
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,310
And the last number is 15.

145
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,120
Don't even know it's the last number, but,
we don't want to keep that one.

146
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,470
And so now, we're done.

147
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,970
So we know that at the end, what was
during the loop the largest so far is

148
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,850
the actual largest of all the numbers, and

149
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,980
we don't remember exactly how many numbers
there were.

150
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,380
So that's kind of like thinking like a

151
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,200
program, you know, this kind of sliding
window.

152
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,580
Didn't matter if I gave you a billion
numbers or five numbers.

153
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,920
I think there were five numbers, actually.

154
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,320
This notion of the largest so far is a
powerful notion.

155
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,900
As a matter of fact, it's central to the
program I've been showing you.

156
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,280
And I don't want you to try to understand
this, but this part in the purple.

157
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,710
This part in the purple is really saying,

158
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,410
I'm going to loop through the counts of
all the words.

159
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,310
So it's got a word like "the" is 15
times, and "clown" is four times.

160
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,590
And it's going to look through all the
pairs of word-value combinations.

161
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,000
And it's going to basically say, I'm

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,860
going to go through the counts that I
have.

163
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,590
And I'm going to check to see if the count
I'm looking at

164
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,730
is bigger than the biggest count I've
seen so far.

165
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,330
And if it is, I'm going to remember it.

166
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,490
Now, don't worry about this.

167
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,960
We haven't even covered any of this stuff.

168
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,700
That's what chapter two, three, four,
five, six.

169
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,250
But this is an algorithm, a paragraph, a
pattern.

170
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,430
That allows you to find the largest
number, and we'll

171
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,270
look at this again in great detail in
upcoming chapters.

172
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,680
So this is kind of thinking like

173
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,960
a computer, having a sliding window across
the

174
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,970
long list of numbers, and coming up with

175
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,370
something that is the answer that you
need.

176
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,570
Okay, so that's the end of this lecture.

177
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,080
Read Chapter One, write your Hello World
program.

178
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,560
Make sure if you haven't, get Python
installed.

179
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,470
As you read this chapter and even as you

180
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,930
install Python, and even as you write the
first program,

181
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,240
don't get too stuck on the details.

182
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,410
I was confused for like eight weeks or six

183
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,490
weeks in my first programming class;
you'll be confused too.

184
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,870
Just sort of wander through with me, keep
at it.

185
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,690
It will start making sense at some point
that's up

186
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,900
to you, I can't tell you when it's
going to make sense.

187
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,430
So, if, don't sort of stare at everything
until you get it.

188
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,090
Just kind of keep digging in, and keep
understanding, and keep playing and

189
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,240
sooner or later this'll make a lot of
sense to you, I promise you.

190
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,010
See you next lecture.
