1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,570
So, we always start all programming
classes with hardware architecture.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,120
I, I don't think it's essential, so don't
get too excited about it.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,440
It's a good

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,310
use of terminology so we can have some
words

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,810
like, say, like CPU and you don't freak
out.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,980
Or memory, or RAM, or disk drive and you
don't freak out.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,910
I don't want to turn you into a hardware
nut. I just want you

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,260
to kind of have a few words so we can talk
about what's going on inside.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,640
Because, in a sense, we're going to be
writing

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,150
programs to do stuff, both data,
instructions, et cetera.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,120
So, here's some hardware that I just
bought

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,420
a couple weeks ago and I'm really in love
with,

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,400
and that is the Raspberry Pi.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,130
This is a single-board
computer.

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,530
It's got storage on an SD card right
there.

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,680
That's the operating system and the data.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,120
And it's got the both a microprocessor and
the memory is in

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,200
here, as well, and it hooks up with USB
and HDMI and

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,220
various things, and if you want, in this
course, you probably can

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,460
do all of the homework using a Raspberry
Pi if you so desire.

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,490
So, this is what hardware really looks
like.

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,100
It's kind of the inside of something.

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,980
Normally, it's in some kind of case and
you don't get to see it.

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,900
And that's what it looks like.

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,340
It's kind of got this green and little
silver and gold.

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,600
I think they're very beautiful.

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,970
They're very pretty.

28
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,670
A lot of engineering goes into making these
things.

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,980
And and so we kind of have a block diagram
of

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,520
what's going on in here, and there's some,
just some terminology.

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,370
The, the brains of it all, well.

32
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,820
We draw this black diagram partly because,
and this is

33
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,990
a, from a, oh, parts are coming off of
this.

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:45,750
Eh.

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,830
I don't know what that was.

36
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,100
It's okay, it's broken anyways.

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,280
And if you have a desktop computer, this
is more like what it looks like inside.

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,850
This part is called a motherboard, and
it's kind

39
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,620
of like the thing that connects and brings
everything together.

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,150
It's got a bunch of wires.

41
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,600
Each one of those little lines here is a
wire.

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,930
It's covered with sort of a lacquer.

43
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,560
And then there are things that penetrate

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,830
the board, and then connect to various
chips.

45
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,490
And this whole thing is what this picture
is.

46
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,700
But it really is connecting a number of
different components.

47
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,510
The central processing unit that I've
spoken of before.

48
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,370
Put that back down.

49
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,054
[SOUND] Central processing unit is the
closest thing a

50
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:26,750
computer has to a brain, but it's barely a
brain.

51
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,380
It's really just a super fast programmable
calculator.

52
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,670
It, we make it flexible by our creativity
when we write programs.

53
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,320
We make it seem intelligent.

54
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,770
It's people that make it intelligent by
taking our own knowledge

55
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,000
and putting it in.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,600
This is not itself intelligent, there's
nothing to fear from this.

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,630
It's just not that smart.

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,400
So, this is the thing that's programmed to
ask the question "what's next?"

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,680
And then we have to have a set of
instructions

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,370
that feed this thing really fast, billions
of times a second.

61
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,500
And that's what this is, this is the
random access memory.

62
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,290
And we have memory chips and

63
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,790
they're connected together through the
motherboard.

64
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,990
So, we have the main memory and we have
the central processing unit.

65
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,870
And this is where our high-speed
instructions come

66
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,470
from, this is where our high-speed data is
stored.

67
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,110
And this is the thing that asks "what next?"
and it reads its instructions from here.

68
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,640
And you'll see that kind of like, oop,
they're not

69
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,790
quite connected together but eventually
they're kind of connecting together.

70
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,560
Don't feel too bad about this hardware
it's all

71
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840
old and it's all broken and it can't be
hurt.

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,610
So, the next thing we got is input/output
device.

73
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,160
So I'll go back to my Raspberry Pi.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,980
So the Raspberry Pi has a USB

75
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,190
that you can connect a mouse or a keyboard.

76
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,150
It has a HDMI that you can connect a
monitor to.

77
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,490
I has an Ethernet connector.

78
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,770
So these are all examples of

79
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,100
input/output devices.

80
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,870
And then the last thing on the screen
is the secondary memory.

81
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,380
So, this RAM [SOUND] on the Raspberry Pi,
the CPU, the central processing

82
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,495
unit and the RAM are all on this one chip
in the middle.

83
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:07,780
It's called SOC or system on a chip where
they put more parts there.

84
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,280
So in a sense it collapsed

85
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,590
this, and this, and a lot of this
all down in the Raspberry Pi

86
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,140
to one little guy.

87
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,320
But it's still architecturally the same
thing.

88
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,900
There's a central processing unit.

89
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,690
There's main memory.

90
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,376
There's graphics cards, etc.

91
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:31,030
[SOUND] So, input/output devices.

92
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,940
Oh, this big

93
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,020
this guy has input/output devices too,
like USB and keyboard, monitor, etc.

94
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,230
So they're, they're very similar.

95
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,770
It's just, this is new, and this is old.

96
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,370
Everything gets smaller when it gets
newer.

97
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,607
Okay.

98
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:48,640
[SOUND] Okay.

99
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,990
So the last thing we gotta talk about is
the secondary memory.

100
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,490
Well,

101
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,720
when the power goes off, these things sort
of go away.

102
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,830
The data in this RAM goes away.

103
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,210
It's just designed to be really fast.

104
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,450
But not permanent.

105
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,600
So we need a place that's permanent,
that's what secondary storage is.

106
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,260
That's what, that's what this secondary
storage is for, this is permanent.

107
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,820
This is fast, and it cha cha cha cha cha
really fast.

108
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,290
And but this is permanent, and this is
slower.

109
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,900
Okay?

110
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,110
So the secondary memory.

111
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,480
[SOUND] I've got two kind of secondary
memory.

112
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,105
Oh, dropped it on the floor.

113
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:28,740
[SOUND] Two kinds of secondary memory.

114
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,480
I'll start with the Raspberry Pi.

115
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,940
The secondary memory of the Raspberry Pi
is this SD card.

116
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,380
It's like a disk drive.

117
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,210
It still is permanent.

118
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,540
Does not require power to maintain its
data.

119
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,110
The data stays permanent.

120
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,220
So, in the future we will see more

121
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,220
of these flash-style drives and SD-style
drives.

122
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,040
So the Raspberry Pi is kind of alluding to
the future.

123
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,540
[SOUND] There's a disk drive in here.

124
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,410
It's not really a disk.

125
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,190
It's also flash memory.

126
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,970
But in the old days, in the good old days,
back when I was a kid,

127
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,150
we, our secondary memory was [SOUND] a
disk drive,

128
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,760
and it had [SOUND] platters, and it spun,
and it made a satisfying noise.

129
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,640
And it would move in and out to read data,
and

130
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,495
I'll show you a video of this just in a
bit.

131
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:19,420
[SOUND] And so these would record the data
on the magnetic platters

132
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,450
and then when the power's taken off, the
data would still be magnetized.

133
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,480
And then it would go and move to the

134
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,260
right spot, [SOUND] spin it around, and
read the data.

135
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,740
And again, this is kind of messed up in a
pretty bad way.

136
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,290
So, there we go.

137
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,570
Central processing unit, brains of the
operation, main memory, fast,

138
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,060
but goes away when we power on, input
output devices, keyboards, et cetera.

139
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,740
And then storage, that has, maintains its
data across power cycles.

140
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,480
Okay, and I just said all that.

141
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,980
Okay?

142
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,340
So then the question is, where do you
belong in this?

143
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,570
Where do programs live?

144
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,980
Where do we write?

145
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,180
And the answer is, we kind of live in the
memory, right.

146
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,320
What we do is we put our programs
into the

147
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,250
memory and then the CPU pulls the programs
out of the memory.

148
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,530
So we have to write our programs and put
them into the memory.

149
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,990
When we start them and run them we're
really loading them

150
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,590
into the memory so they can be fed rapidly
to the CPU.

151
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,400
Now the computers don't really execute
Python, like "if x less

152
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,420
than three print", but that's what we tend
to want to write.

153
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,290
Because what the computers really execute
is a thing called

154
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,490
machine language, which is a series of
zeroes and ones

155
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,880
that pretty much translate directly to
what's on these pins.

156
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,900
There's voltages that go up and down.

157
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,830
That's called machine language.

158
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,900
Source code, like Python, is written in a

159
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,260
way that's most convenient, well, at least
more convenient.

160
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,510
Machine language is what's most
convenient

161
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,700
for the hardware.

162
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,320
So we either, we have to translate from
source code to

163
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,720
machine language, and that's what the
Python program does for us.

164
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,030
We write in Python, and Python translates
to machine language for us.

165
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,570
So, I got a couple of videos that
give you a sense of how this all works.

166
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,500
We'll start with CPU.

167
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,270
And what this is going to do is, this is
going to show you the intensity of

168
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,380
how much electricity, the thing that gets
hot

169
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,530
inside your computer is this little guy
right here.

170
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,625
And we're going to see in this video just
how hot it can get.

171
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:34,050
[SOUND].

172
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,290
Okay, so welcome back.

173
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,860
So the next thing I'm going to show you

174
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,660
I showed you a hard disk that
sort of didn't work.

175
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,920
But we're actually going to show you a
real short video on how a hard

176
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,990
disk works [SOUND] that someone took the

177
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,220
cover off and actually applied power to
it.

178
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,730
You don't want to do this yourself if you
have a

179
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,770
hard drive, I've read, and some people say
that you can do

180
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,910
it for a, for a few minutes and
then the drive

181
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,590
kind of destroys itself if you run it with
the cover off.

182
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,562
So let's take a look at this.
