Python For Everyone
===================

HTML Version
------------

This zip file contains two HTML versions of the book Python for Everyone
by Charles Severance.  The first, in the `/embeds` folder, contains interactive
examples in embedded trinkets.  Because these examples are run on servers, 
they require an internet connection.  The second, in `/offline`, has static
code blocks instead of interactive examples and will work without an internet
connection.

The text of the book is © Charles R. Severance. The interactive version is
© Trinket. Both are freely reusable and remixable under a [CC-NC-BY](1) license.
