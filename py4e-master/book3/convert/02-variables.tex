\chapter{Variables, expressions, and statements}

\section{Values and types}
\index{value}
\index{type}
\index{string}

A {\bf value} is one of the basic things a program works with,
like a letter or a
number.  The values we have seen so far
are {\tt 1}, {\tt 2}, and
\verb"'Hello, World!'"

These values belong to different {\bf types}:
{\tt 2} is an integer, and \verb"'Hello, World!'" is a {\bf string},
so called because it contains a ``string'' of letters.
You (and the interpreter) can identify
strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.

\index{quotation mark}

The {\tt print} statement also works for integers.  We use the 
{\tt python} command to start the interpreter.

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
python
>>> print 4
4
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> type('Hello, World!')
<type 'str'>
>>> type(17)
<type 'int'>
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type {\tt str} and
integers belong to the type {\tt int}.  Less obviously, numbers
with a decimal point belong to a type called {\tt float},
because these numbers are represented in a
format called {\bf floating point}.

\index{type}
\index{string type}
\index{type!str}
\index{int type}
\index{type!int}
\index{float type}
\index{type!float}

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> type(3.2)
<type 'float'>
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
What about values like \verb"'17'" and \verb"'3.2'"?
They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like
strings.

\index{quotation mark}

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> type('17')
<type 'str'>
>>> type('3.2')
<type 'str'>
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
They're strings.

When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas
between groups of three digits, as in {\tt 1,000,000}.  This is not a
legal integer in Python, but it is legal:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> print 1,000,000
1 0 0
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
Well, that's not what we expected at all!  Python interprets {\tt
  1,000,000} as a comma-separated sequence of integers, which it
prints with spaces between.

\index{semantic error}
\index{error!semantic}
\index{error message}

This is the first example we have seen of a semantic error: the code
runs without producing an error message, but it doesn't do the
``right'' thing.


\section{Variables}
\index{variable}
\index{assignment statement}
\index{statement!assignment}

One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the
ability to manipulate {\bf variables}.  A variable is a name that
refers to a value.

An {\bf assignment statement} creates new variables and gives
them values:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
>>> n = 17
>>> pi = 3.1415926535897931
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
This example makes three assignments.  The first assigns a string
to a new variable named {\tt message};
the second assigns the integer {\tt 17} to {\tt n}; the third
assigns the (approximate) value of $\pi$ to {\tt pi}.

To display the value of a variable, you can use a print statement:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> print n
17
>>> print pi
3.14159265359
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> type(message)
<type 'str'>
>>> type(n)
<type 'int'>
>>> type(pi)
<type 'float'>
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%

\section{Variable names and keywords}
\index{keyword}

Programmers generally choose names for their variables that
are meaningful and document what the variable is used for.

Variable names can be arbitrarily long.  They can contain
both letters and numbers, but they cannot start with a number.
It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea
to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you'll
see why later).

The underscore character (\verb"_") can appear in a name.
It is often used in names with multiple words, such as
\verb"my_name" or \verb"airspeed_of_unladen_swallow".
Variable names can start with an underscore character, but
we generally avoid doing this unless we are writing library 
code for others to use.

\index{underscore character}

If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> 76trombones = 'big parade'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> more@ = 1000000
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
{\tt 76trombones} is illegal because it begins with a number.
{\tt more@} is illegal because it contains an illegal character, {\tt
@}.  But what's wrong with {\tt class}?

It turns out that {\tt class} is one of Python's {\bf keywords}.  The
interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program,
and they cannot be used as variable names.

\index{keyword}

Python reserves 31 keywords\footnote{In Python 3.0, {\tt exec} is no
longer a keyword, but {\tt nonlocal} is.} for its use:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
and       del       from      not       while    
as        elif      global    or        with     
assert    else      if        pass      yield    
break     except    import    print              
class     exec      in        raise              
continue  finally   is        return             
def       for       lambda    try
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
You might want to keep this list handy.  If the interpreter complains
about one of your variable names and you don't know why, see if it
is on this list.

\section{Statements}

A {\bf statement} is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can
execute.  We have seen two kinds of statements: print
and assignment.

\index{statement}
\index{interactive mode}
\index{script mode}

When you type a statement in interactive mode, the interpreter
executes it and displays the result, if there is one.

A script usually contains a sequence of statements.  If there
is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time
as the statements execute.

For example, the script

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
print 1
x = 2
print x
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
produces the output

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
1
2
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
The assignment statement produces no output.


\section{Operators and operands}
\index{operator, arithmetic}
\index{arithmetic operator}
\index{operand}
\index{expression}

{\bf Operators} are special symbols that represent computations like
addition and multiplication.  The values the operator is applied to
are called {\bf operands}.

The operators {\tt +}, {\tt -}, {\tt *}, {\tt /}, and {\tt **}
perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
exponentiation, as in the following examples:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
20+32   hour-1   hour*60+minute   minute/60   5**2   (5+9)*(15-7)
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
The division operator might not do what you expect:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> minute = 59
>>> minute/60
0
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
The value of {\tt minute} is 59, and in conventional arithmetic 59
divided by 60 is 0.98333, not 0.  The reason for the discrepancy is
that Python is performing {\bf floor division}\footnote{In Python 3.0,
the result of this division is a {\tt float}.  
In Python 3.0, the new operator
{\tt //} performs integer division.}.

\index{Python 3.0}
\index{floor division}
\index{floating-point division}
\index{division!floor}
\index{division!floating-point}

When both of the operands are integers, the result is also an
integer; floor division chops off the fractional
part, so in this example it truncates the answer to zero.

If either of the operands is a floating-point number, Python performs
floating-point division, and the result is a {\tt float}:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> minute/60.0
0.98333333333333328
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb


\section{Expressions}

An {\bf expression} is a combination of values, variables, and operators.
A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is
a variable, so the following are all legal expressions
(assuming that the variable {\tt x} has been assigned a value):

\index{expression}
\index{evaluate}

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
17
x
x + 17
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
If you type an expression in interactive mode, the interpreter
{\bf evaluates} it and displays the result:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> 1 + 1
2
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
But in a script, an expression all by itself doesn't
do anything!  This is a common
source of confusion for beginners.

\begin{ex}
Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see
what they do:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
5
x = 5
x + 1
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
\end{ex}


\section{Order of operations}
\index{order of operations}
\index{rules of precedence}
\index{PEMDAS}

When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of
evaluation depends on the {\bf rules of precedence}.  For
mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention.
The acronym {\bf PEMDAS} is a useful way to
remember the rules:

\index{parentheses!overriding precedence}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf P}arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used 
to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since
expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, {\tt 2 * (3-1)} is 4,
and {\tt (1+1)**(5-2)} is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an
expression easier to read, as in {\tt (minute * 100) / 60}, even
if it doesn't change the result.

\item {\bf E}xponentiation has the next highest precedence, so
{\tt 2**1+1} is 3, not 4, and {\tt 3*1**3} is 3, not 27.

\item {\bf M}ultiplication and {\bf D}ivision have the same precedence,
which is higher than {\bf A}ddition and {\bf S}ubtraction, which also
have the same precedence.  So {\tt 2*3-1} is 5, not 4, and
{\tt 6+4/2} is 8, not 5.

\item Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to 
right.  So the expression {\tt 5-3-1} is 1, not 3, because the
{\tt 5-3} happens first and then {\tt 1} is subtracted from {\tt 2}.

\end{itemize}

When in doubt, always put parentheses in your expressions to make sure
the computations are performed in the order you intend.

\section{Modulus operator}

\index{modulus operator}
\index{operator!modulus}

The {\bf modulus operator} works on integers and yields the remainder
when the first operand is divided by the second.  In Python, the
modulus operator is a percent sign (\verb"%").  The syntax is the same
as for other operators:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> quotient = 7 / 3
>>> print quotient
2
>>> remainder = 7 % 3
>>> print remainder
1
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
So 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.

The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful.  For
example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another---if
{\tt x \% y} is zero, then {\tt x} is divisible by {\tt y}.

\index{divisibility}

You can also extract the right-most digit
or digits from a number.  For example, {\tt x \% 10} yields the
right-most digit of {\tt x} (in base 10).  Similarly, {\tt x \% 100}
yields the last two digits.



\section{String operations}
\index{string!operation}
\index{operator!string}

The {\tt +} operator works with strings, but it
is not addition in the mathematical sense. Instead it performs
{\bf concatenation}, which means joining the strings by
linking them end to end.  For example:

\index{concatenation}

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> first = 10
>>> second = 15
>>> print first+second
25
>>> first = '100'
>>> second = '150'
>>> print first + second
100150
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
The output of this program is {\tt 100150}.

\section{Asking the user for input}
\index{keyboard input}

Sometimes we would like to take the value for a variable from the user
via their keyboard.
Python provides a built-in function called \verb"raw_input" that gets
input from the keyboard\footnote{In Python 3.0, this function is named
  {\tt input}.}.  When this function is called, the program stops and
waits for the user to type something.  When the user presses {\sf
  Return} or {\sf Enter}, the program resumes and \verb"raw_input"
returns what the user typed as a string.

\index{Python 3.0}
\index{raw\_input function}
\index{function!raw\_input}

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> input = raw_input()
Some silly stuff
>>> print input
Some silly stuff
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a
prompt telling the user what to input.  You can pass a string
to \verb"raw_input" to be displayed to the user before pausing
for input:

\index{prompt}

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> name = raw_input('What is your name?\n')
What is your name?
Chuck
>>> print name
Chuck
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
The sequence \verb"\n" at the end of the prompt represents a {\bf newline},
which is a special character that causes a line break.
That's why the user's input appears below the prompt.

\index{newline}

If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert
the return value to {\tt int} using the {\tt int()} function:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n'
>>> speed = raw_input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
17
>>> int(speed)
17
>>> int(speed) + 5
22
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
But if the user types something other than a string of digits,
you get an error:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> speed = raw_input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?
>>> int(speed)
ValueError: invalid literal for int()
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
We will see how to handle this kind of error later.

\index{ValueError}
\index{exception!ValueError}


\section{Comments}
\index{comment}

As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult
to read.  Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to
look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.

For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain
in natural language what the program is doing.  These notes are called
{\bf comments}, and in Python they start with the \verb"#" symbol:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself.  You can also put
comments at the end of a line:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60     # percentage of an hour
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
Everything from the {\tt \#} to the end of the line is ignored---it
has no effect on the program.

Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of
the code.  It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out
\emph{what} the code does; it is much more useful to explain \emph{why}.

This comment is redundant with the code and useless:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
v = 5     # assign 5 to v
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
This comment contains useful information that is not in the code:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
v = 5     # velocity in meters/second. 
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but
long names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is
a trade-off.

\section{Choosing mnemonic variable names}

\index{mnemonic}

As long as you follow the simple rules of variable naming, and avoid
reserved words, you have a lot of choice when you name your variables.
In the beginning, this choice can be confusing both when you read a 
program and when you write your own programs.  For example, the
following three programs are identical in terms of what they accomplish,
but very different when you read them and try to understand them.

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
a = 35.0
b = 12.50
c = a * b
print c

hours = 35.0
rate = 12.50
pay = hours * rate
print pay

x1q3z9ahd = 35.0
x1q3z9afd = 12.50
x1q3p9afd = x1q3z9ahd * x1q3z9afd
print x1q3p9afd
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
The Python interpreter sees all three of these programs as \emph{exactly the 
same} but humans see and understand these programs quite differently.  
Humans will most quickly understand the {\bf intent} 
of the second program because the 
programmer has chosen variable names that reflect their intent
regarding what data will be stored in each variable.

We call these wisely chosen variable names ``mnemonic variable names''.  The
word \emph{mnemonic}\footnote{See 
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic}
for an extended description of the word ``mnemonic''.} 
means ``memory aid''.
We choose mnemonic variable names to help us remember why we created the variable
in the first place.

While this all sounds great, and it is a very good idea to use mnemonic variable
names, mnemonic variable names can get in the way of a beginning programmer's 
ability to parse and understand code.  This is because beginning programmers 
have not yet memorized the reserved words (there are only 31 of them) and sometimes
variables with names that are too descriptive start to look like 
part of the language and not just well-chosen variable names.

Take a quick look at the following Python sample code which loops through some data. 
We will cover loops soon, but for now try to just puzzle through what this means:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
for word in words:
    print word
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
What is happening here?  Which of the tokens (for, word, in, etc.) are reserved words
and which are just variable names?  Does Python understand at a fundamental level 
the notion of words?  Beginning programmers have 
trouble separating what parts of the
code \emph{must} be the same as this example and what parts of the code are simply
choices made by the programmer.

The following code is equivalent to the above code:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
for slice in pizza:
    print slice
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
It is easier for the beginning programmer to look at this code and know which 
parts are reserved words defined by Python and which parts are simply variable
names chosen by the programmer.  It is pretty clear that Python has no fundamental
understanding of pizza and slices and the fact that a pizza consists of a set
of one or more slices.

But if our program is truly about reading data and looking for words in the data,
{\tt pizza} and {\tt slice} are very un-mnemonic variable names.  Choosing them 
as variable names distracts from the meaning of the program.

After a pretty short period of time, you will know the most common reserved words
and you will start to see the reserved words jumping out at you:

{\tt {\bf for} word {\bf in} words{\bf :}\\
\verb"    "{\bf print} word }

The parts of the code that are defined by 
Python ({\tt for}, {\tt in}, {\tt print}, and {\tt :}) are in bold
and the programmer-chosen variables ({\tt word} and {\tt words}) are not in bold.  
Many text editors are aware of Python
syntax and will color reserved words differently to give you clues to keep 
your variables and reserved words separate.
After a while you will begin to read Python and quickly determine what
is a variable and what is a reserved word.

\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

At this point, the syntax error you are most likely to make is
an illegal variable name, like {\tt class} and {\tt yield}, which
are keywords, or \verb"odd~job" and \verb"US$", which contain
illegal characters.

\index{syntax error}
\index{error!syntax}

If you put a space in a variable name, Python thinks it is two
operands without an operator:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> bad name = 5
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
For syntax errors, the error messages don't help much.
The most common messages are {\tt SyntaxError: invalid syntax} and
{\tt SyntaxError: invalid token}, neither of which is very informative.

\index{error message}
\index{use before def}
\index{exception}
\index{runtime error}
\index{error!runtime}

The runtime error you are most likely to make is a ``use before
def;'' that is, trying to use a variable before you have assigned
a value.  This can happen if you spell a variable name wrong:

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> principal = 327.68
>>> interest = principle * rate
NameError: name 'principle' is not defined
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
Variables names are case sensitive, so {\tt LaTeX} is not the
same as {\tt latex}.

\index{case-sensitivity, variable names}
\index{semantic error}
\index{error!semantic}

At this point, the most likely cause of a semantic error is
the order of operations.  For example, to evaluate $\frac{1}{2 \pi}$,
you might be tempted to write

\beforeverb
\begin{verbatim}
>>> 1.0 / 2.0 * pi
\end{verbatim}
\afterverb
%
But the division happens first, so you would get $\pi / 2$, which
is not the same thing!  There is no way for Python
to know what you meant to write, so in this case you don't
get an error message; you just get the wrong answer.

\section{Exercises}

\begin{ex}
Write a program that uses  \verb"raw_input" to prompt a user for their name 
and then welcomes them.

\begin{verbatim}
Enter your name: Chuck
Hello Chuck
\end{verbatim}

\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute
gross pay.
\begin{verbatim}
Enter Hours: 35
Enter Rate: 2.75
Pay: 96.25
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
%
We won't worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after
the decimal place for now.  If you want, you can play with the 
built-in Python {\tt round} function to properly round the resulting pay
to two decimal places.

\begin{ex}
Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

\begin{verbatim}
width = 17
height = 12.0
\end{verbatim}

For each of the following expressions, write the value of the
expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\tt width/2}

\item {\tt width/2.0}

\item {\tt height/3}

\item {\tt 1 + 2 * 5}

\end{enumerate}

Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature,
convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted
temperature.
\end{ex}
