Subject: Re: I will send you a copy of "Python for Informatics"

Hi Chuck,

1) Thanks for sending me a copy.Â  The best address for me is
.............. Needham MA 02492.

2) About the FDL requirement to include the entire license,
I agree that it is a nuisance, and I hereby grant you permission to
produce a modified version of Think Python subject to the terms of
the GNU FDL but excluding the requirement to include the entire
license.

3) I am the sole copyright holder on Think Python, so I hereby grant you permission to produce a modified version of Think Python under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license (whichever version you like).

(BTW, Green Tea Press is me)

Good luck with your class!

Allen
