<h1>Contributing to Python Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3.0</h1>
<p>
After many years as a successful Open Python 2.0 textbook, the time
has come to update Python for Informatics to be Python 3.0.
There will be a lot of work since the Python 2.0 textbook and slides
have been translated into so many languages and there are five courses
on Coursera all built around the textbook.
</p>
<p>
We have a build server that re-builds the entire book every hour at:
<pre>
<a href="http://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/" target="_blank">http://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/</a>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
You can order a print copy of a pre-release draft of the book from 
<a href="http://amzn.to/1qCFO95" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.
</p>
<p>
While there are several groups that will likely translate the book and/or
slides into Python 3.0, lets wait until the book is relatively solid to make
sure that all of the variations of these materials are well aligned.
</p>
<h2>Temporary Copyright</h2>
<p>
While I am in the process of drafting a book, I do not put it up with a Creative
Commons license.   I don't want anyone grabbing the half-completed text
and publishing it prematurely.  Once the book is in reasonably good shape 
I switch the copyright to my normal CC license (CC-BY-NC for print 
books and CC-BY for all electronic copies).  I expect the book to be ready to 
release in early 2016.
</p>
<h2>Contributing to the Book</h2>
<p>
The entire text of the book is in GitHub in this repository:
<pre>
<a href="https://github.com/csev/py4e" target="_blank">https://github.com/csev/py4e</a>
</pre>
There are two basic ways to contribute to the book:
<ul>
<li>Create a GitHub account, then navigate to one of the files for the book
in the repository like <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/csev/py4e/blob/master/book/02-variables.mkd" target="_blank">https://github.com/csev/py4e/blob/master/book/02-variables.mkd</a><br/>

Press the pencil icon to edit the text, and then when you "save" the text, 
it sends me a "pull request" where I can review your changes, approve them, 
and apply them to the master copy.  Once you get going, it is really easy.
</li>
<li>
If you have more tech-skillz, you can "fork" the repository and send me pull
requests the normal way.  If you use this approach, please send pull requests
quickly so we all stay synchronized.  Don't worry about trying to squeeze 
a bunch of work into a single comment (like many projects prefer).   Lots of
little commits avoid merge conflicts.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Make sure to take a look at the 
<a href="https://github.com/csev/py4e/blob/master/book/TODO.md" target="_blank">TODO list</a> to figure out where you can help.
</p>
Since the build server that re-builds the entire book every hour,
you can see your contributions appearing in the final book within an hour
of me approving your pull request.
GitHub tracks your contribution and gives you credit for everything you do.
Once the book is ready to publish, I will go through the GitHub history and 
add acknowledgements for all of the contributions to the text of the book.
</p>
<p>
If you send in a pull request and it seems like I am not moving quickly
enough for you, simply send a tweet with the URL of the pull request 
and mention
<a href="https://twitter.com/drchuck" target="_blank">@drchuck</a>.  That will
make sure I see it and get working on it.
</p>
<h2>Thanks in Advance</h2>
<p>
I appreciate your interest, support, and effort in helping make this 
open book a success for all these years.

I want to make sure to 
acknowledge the contributions from 
authors of

Their original groundbreaking work in building an open and remixable
textbook in 2002 has made the current work possible.
